# My portfolio

## My portfolio website, which I am constantly trying to improve.
The project is based on Responsive Web Design, without using any CSS framework. To make this site responsive I used the Flexbox layout model.


### Other technologies and tools I used to create my portfolio:
* JQuery
* Sass
* Webpack
* particles.js library
* Yarn
